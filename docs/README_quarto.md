# Hedge-Forge Quarto Documentation

This repository contains the **Quarto documentation** for the Hedge-Forge portfolio optimization project.

The goal of this documentation is to produce **client-facing, professional reports** suitable for:

- Technical stakeholders
- Hiring managers
- Clients interested in understanding portfolio optimization methods and results

## üìÇ Project File Structure

The documentation files are organized as follows:

```

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.qmd                  # Executive summary / overview
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ methodology.qmd            # Stochastic modeling, math background
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data_pipeline.qmd          # Data collection, cleaning, and processing steps
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ eda.qmd                    # Exploratory Data Analysis
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ optimization_results.qmd   # Output, charts, interpretations

‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ appendix.qmd               # Additional formulas, derivations, references
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _quarto.yml                # Quarto configuration for site structure and appearance
```

Below is a brief description of what each file contains.

## üí° Why Use Quarto?

The Hedge-Forge documentation uses Quarto because it:

‚úÖ Combines narrative text, math equations, code, and visuals seamlessly  
‚úÖ Produces clean, professional HTML and PDF reports  
‚úÖ Handles LaTeX equations for financial modeling  
‚úÖ Supports multi-page documentation with logical navigation  
‚úÖ Works well for both internal and client-facing deliverables

## üöÄ How to Build and View the Documentation

Follow these steps to build and view the Hedge-Forge documentation locally.

### 1. Install Quarto

Download and install Quarto from:

[https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)

---

### 2. Navigate to the Project Directory

From your terminal:

```bash
cd hedge_forge/docs
```

---

### 3. Render the Documentation

To build the entire documentation site, run:

```bash
quarto render
```

This generates the HTML website in the `_site/` directory.

---

### 4. Preview the Documentation Locally

For live preview with auto-reload:

```bash
quarto preview
```

By default, this runs a local web server at:

```
http://localhost:4200
```

Open that URL in your web browser to browse the documentation.

---

### 5. Open the Site Manually

Alternatively, open the main HTML file directly:

- Navigate to:

    ```
    hedge_forge/docs/_site/index.html
    ```

- Double-click `index.html` or open it in your browser of choice.

---

### Optional: Build PDF Version

To generate a PDF report instead of HTML:

1. Add the following to `_quarto.yml`:

    ```yaml
    format:
      pdf:
        documentclass: article
    ```

2. Run:

    ```bash
    quarto render --to pdf
    ```

This produces a single PDF file with all pages combined.
