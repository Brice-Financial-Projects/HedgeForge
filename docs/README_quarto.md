# Hedge-Forge Quarto Documentation

This document describes the structure and purpose of the **Quarto-based documentation** for the Hedge-Forge portfolio optimization project.

The goal is to produce **client-facing, professional documentation** suitable for:

- Technical stakeholders
- Hiring managers
- Clients interested in portfolio optimization methods and results

Below is a description of what each file should contain.

## ðŸ“„ Page-by-Page Purpose

### `index.qmd`

- Project overview and purpose
- High-level description of Hedge-Forge
- Architecture diagrams (e.g. how components connect)
- Quick summary of results for non-technical readers

---

### `methodology.qmd`

- Mathematical background of portfolio optimization:
  - Mean-variance theory
  - Sharpe ratio maximization
  - Constraints (e.g. sector caps, no shorting)
- Definitions of risk metrics:
  - volatility
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
  - Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR)
- Explanation of why these methods are used
- LaTeX equations for mathematical clarity

---

### `data_pipeline.qmd`

- Description of the data sources:
  - Market data APIs
  - Synthetic data generation
  - CSV files
- Data validation steps:
  - Missing values
  - Outliers
  - Data type checks
- Pipeline diagram showing the flow:
  - Load â†’ Validate â†’ Transform â†’ Save
- Description of utility functions:
  - load_data()
  - validate_data()
  - compute_log_returns()
  - compute_covariance_matrix()
  - compute_rolling_metrics()

---

### `eda.qmd`

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) findings:
  - Distribution plots of asset returns
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Rolling volatility and trends
- Commentary on insights:
  - Skewness
  - Kurtosis
  - Market clustering or anomalies
- Visualizations to help understand the dataset before modeling

---

### `optimization_results.qmd`

- Description of optimization objectives:
  - Minimum variance portfolio
  - Maximum Sharpe ratio
- Explanation of constraints applied during optimization
- Presentation of optimized portfolios:
  - Weight allocations
  - Expected returns
  - Portfolio volatility
- Visualizations:
  - Efficient frontier plots
  - Comparison of different strategies
- Interpretation of results for stakeholders

---

### `risk_metrics.qmd`

- Definitions and explanations of:
  - Volatility
  - Value at Risk (VaR)
  - Conditional VaR (CVaR)
  - Tracking error
- Calculations and examples applied to optimized portfolios
- Visualizations of risk metrics
- Tables summarizing risk statistics across scenarios

---

### `appendix.qmd`

- Additional derivations or mathematical details
- Extended formulas not shown in main sections
- Troubleshooting notes or modeling assumptions
- Reference list of papers, books, or external resources used during project development

---

### `_quarto.yml`

- Configuration file for Quarto project
- Defines:
  - Website title
  - Navigation menu linking all pages
  - Theme and style (e.g. color schemes)
  - Output formats (HTML, PDF, etc.)
- Ensures all pages are integrated into a cohesive documentation site or PDF report

---

## ðŸ’¡ Why Quarto?

Quarto was chosen for hedge-forge because it:

âœ… Combines text, math, code, and visuals seamlessly  
âœ… Produces clean, professional HTML or PDF reports  
âœ… Supports equations for financial modeling  
âœ… Allows separate pages for clear documentation structure  
âœ… Works well for both internal use and client-facing deliverables

---

## ðŸ”§ Next Steps

- Install Quarto CLI via [https://quarto.org](https://quarto.org)
- Create the `docs/` folder structure
- Draft section headings in each `.qmd` file
- Configure `_quarto.yml` for navigation and themes
- Start writing content for each page
- Render the documentation into HTML or PDF for review

---

*Hedge-Forge aims to be a showcase-level project, and this Quarto documentation will help present it professionally and clearly to clients and stakeholders.*
