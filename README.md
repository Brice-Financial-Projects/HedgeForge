HedgeForge is a Python-based quantitative finance project focused on simulating and optimizing long-term portfolio performance under uncertainty. Using stochastic processes, Monte Carlo simulations, and modern portfolio theory, the engine is being developed to model and evaluate real-world portfolio strategies under risk — with applications in **asset-liability management (ALM)**, **economic scenario generation (ESG)**, and **institutional investing**.

This project is designed with modularity, transparency, and future extensibility in mind. It also serves as a portfolio centerpiece in my career transition from engineering and infrastructure planning into fintech and quantitative modeling.

## 🔍 Key Objectives

- Develop a flexible, research-grade simulation engine for multi-asset portfolio strategies  
- Apply stochastic modeling (e.g., GBM, OU process) to simulate market dynamics  
- Implement portfolio optimization under different risk/utility frameworks  
- Perform rolling backtests on historical and synthetic market data  
- Produce reproducible documentation using Quarto to explain methodology and results  
- Design with scalability in mind (e.g., Streamlit front-end, `cvxpy` constraint-based optimization planned)

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Core**: Python, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, Matplotlib, Quarto  
**Planned**: Streamlit (interactive dashboard), cvxpy (constrained optimization), DuckDB/SQL (data layer)  
**Tooling**: Git, Conda, pytest, VSCode
