## ðŸš€ Project Vision

**Goal:**  
- Build a professional-grade portfolio optimization system
- Understand every component (no vibe coding!)
- Integrate realistic data
- Potentially include a UI (Streamlit) or backend API (FastAPI/Flask)
- Position as a showcase piece for fintech and ML engineering career goals

---

## âœ… Phased Roadmap

Below is a step-by-step plan to develop hedge-forge into a top-tier fintech project.

---

## Phase 1 â€” Project Charter & Math Foundation

Define your business problem:

- **Objective examples:**
  - Minimum variance portfolio
  - Maximum Sharpe ratio
  - Risk parity
  - ESG constraints
  - Transaction costs

- Sketch math:
  - Mean-variance formulas
  - Constraints:
    - weights sum to 1
    - no shorting (weights â‰¥ 0)
    - sector constraints
  - Risk metrics:
    - volatility
    - VaR
    - CVaR

**Deliverables:**

- `internal_docs/roadmap.md`
- `internal_docs/modeling_notes.md`
- `docs/methodology.qmd`

---

## Phase 2 â€” Data Engineering Pipeline

**Tasks:**

- Load synthetic realistic data
- Validate:
  - missing values
  - data types
  - outliers
- Calculate:
  - log returns
  - covariance matrices
  - rolling metrics

**Implementation:**

- `src/utils.py`

**Testing:**

```python
def test_compute_returns():
    # check that returns shape matches expectations
```
    ...

# Hedge-Forge Roadmap â€” Phases 3 and Beyond

## Phase 3 â€” Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize return distributions, correlation matrices, volatility over time
- Understand data behavior: skewness, kurtosis, clustering
- Save notebooks: `notebooks/01_eda.ipynb`
- Document findings: `docs/results.qmd`

---

## Phase 4 â€” Core Optimization Engine

- Implement optimizer logic in `src/optimizer.py`
- Techniques:
  - Minimize volatility
  - Maximize Sharpe ratio
- Constraints:
  - Sum(weights) = 1
  - Weights >= 0
  - Sector caps
  - Single position caps
- Libraries:
  - `cvxpy`
  - `scipy.optimize`
- Unit tests: `tests/test_optimizer.py`

---

## Phase 5 â€” Risk Metrics Module

- Implement VaR, CVaR, rolling volatility, tracking error
- Code in `src/risk.py`
- Tests in `tests/test_risk.py`
- Document methods in `docs/methodology.qmd`

---

## Phase 6 â€” Forecasting Module (Optional)

- Predict returns with:
  - rolling averages
  - regularized regressions
  - tree-based models
- Engineer features: momentum, volatility, macroeconomic
- Code in `src/forecasting.py`
- Tests in `tests/test_forecasting.py`

---

## Phase 7 â€” Backtesting

- Implement walk-forward optimization
- Simulate:
  - slippage
  - transaction costs
- Compare vs benchmarks
- Code in `src/backtest.py`
- Visualize cumulative returns, drawdowns
- Document results in `docs/results.qmd`

---

## Phase 8 â€” UI or API Layer

### Option A â€” Streamlit

- Fast visuals
- Interactive sliders, charts
- Code in `app/main.py`

### Option B â€” FastAPI or Flask

- Backend engineering practice
- JSON inputs/outputs
- Example API:

```json
POST /optimize
{
  "tickers": ["AAPL", "MSFT"],
  "risk_model": "min_vol",
  "constraints": {
    "max_weight": 0.2,
    "sector_limits": {...}
  }
}
```

Code in app/main.py

# Hedge-Forge Roadmap â€” Phases 9 and Beyond

This document captures the roadmap for hedge-forge starting from **Phase 9** through completion.

---

## Phase 9 â€” Documentation & Presentation

Produce strong documentation to showcase hedge-forge as a professional-grade project.

### Deliverables:

- Create Quarto documentation:
  - `docs/index.qmd` â€” Executive summary
  - `docs/methodology.qmd` â€” Mathematical methods and assumptions
  - `docs/results.qmd` â€” Plots, charts, analysis
  - `docs/appendix.qmd` â€” Additional derivations and formulas

- Update `README.md` to include:
  - Project overview
  - Installation instructions
  - Usage examples

Clear, high-quality documentation will make hedge-forge understandable and professional for recruiters, collaborators, and future you.

---

# Hedge-Forge Roadmap â€” Phase 10 and Beyond

This document captures the plan for hedge-forge from Phase 10 onward.

---

## Phase 10 â€” Showcase Polish

The final phase transforms hedge-forge from a working prototype into a polished, professional-grade showcase.

### Tasks:

- Apply consistent code formatting using Black:

    black .

- Run static code analysis:

    flake8

- Check type annotations for robustness:

    mypy src/

- Replace all print statements with structured logging for production-quality code.

Example:

    import logging

    logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
    logger.info("Optimization completed successfully.")

- Create a CLI entry point script to run the entire modeling pipeline:

    scripts/run_pipeline.py

- Consider Dockerizing the entire project for:
    - reproducibility
    - simplified deployment
    - environment consistency

- Deploy the finished application:
    - Deploy a Streamlit app for interactive demos and visualizations.
    - Or deploy a FastAPI backend for programmatic access and integrations.

Polishing ensures hedge-forge is robust, maintainable, and ready for professional presentation and portfolio showcasing.

---

## Streamlit vs. FastAPI Decision

- **Streamlit** is ideal for:
    - rapid, interactive demos
    - easy-to-build UI with sliders, plots, and tables
    - engaging non-technical stakeholders

- **FastAPI** is ideal for:
    - backend development experience
    - scalable REST API endpoints
    - integration with enterprise systems or frontend applications

**Ideal scenario:** implement both:
- A Streamlit frontend for interactive exploration and demos.
- A FastAPI backend for robust, programmatic integrations.

---

## Immediate Priorities

Recommended immediate steps for hedge-forge:

| Priority | Task |
|----------|------|
| ðŸ¥‡ | Complete documentation in Quarto and README.md |
| ðŸ¥ˆ | Run code formatting, linting, and static checks |
| ðŸ¥‰ | Replace all print statements with proper logging |
| âœ… | Build a CLI entry point for seamless pipeline execution |
| âœ… | Decide on deployment approach (Streamlit, FastAPI, or both) |
| âœ… | Test deployment and polish the entire presentation |

---

# ðŸ”¥ Project Outcome

When Phase 10 and beyond are complete, hedge-forge will be:

âœ… A senior-level fintech showcase project  
âœ… A bridge from civil engineering â†’ fintech â†’ ML engineering  
âœ… A portfolio centerpiece demonstrating:
- advanced optimization algorithms
- risk analytics
- clean data engineering pipelines
- backend or frontend development expertise

**Next immediate actions:**

- Finalize any remaining modules (e.g. optimizer logic)
- Complete tests and documentation
- Deploy the chosen frontend or backend
- Polish hedge-forge for portfolio-level presentation

---

*Brice, Phase 10 is what will elevate hedge-forge into a flagship project that showcases your skills and expertise for your future fintech and ML engineering career. Letâ€™s finish strong!*
